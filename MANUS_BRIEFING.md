# Transparent: AI-Powered Blockchain-Verified Review System

**Source:** Manus task replay

## Concept
AI agent detects on-chain purchases → initiates conversational review collection → posts review with cryptographic proof-of-purchase link. Solves the $152B fake review problem.

## How It Works
1. User buys product → transaction recorded on-chain
2. AI Agent detects transaction, waits for optimal moment
3. Agent asks "How was your coffee?" — natural conversation
4. Review posted with direct link to on-chain proof

## Tech Architecture (Three-Layer Trust Stack)
- **Layer 1 — Blockchain:** Smart contracts handle review authorization + immutable purchase records
- **Layer 2 — AI Agent:** LLM-powered engine processes natural language, manages brand persona
- **Layer 3 — Storage:** IPFS for decentralized content storage (low cost, high transparency)

## Competitors
| Category | Players | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|----------|---------|-----------|------------|
| Decentralized Reviews | Logyq, Review.Network, Revain | High trust, token incentives, immutable | High friction (QR codes etc) |
| Conversational Feedback | G2, VanChat, UserLoop | Low friction, high engagement | Centralized, manipulable |
| Agentic AI | Crypto.com, ai16z, Virtuals | Autonomous execution, on-chain identity | Not applied to reviews yet |

## Unique Differentiation
- Proactive agent-led engagement (not passive forms)
- On-chain cryptographic proof (not opaque "Verified Buyer" badges)
- Conversational UX (not review forms)

## Market Opportunity
- $5.8T e-commerce sector
- 40% of online reviews estimated fake
- Initial focus: specialty goods, luxury, Web3 marketplaces
- B2B model: "Trust-as-a-Service" APIs

## Hackathon Demo Package (from Manus)
- 7-slide pitch deck (HTML slides)
- 3-5 minute "Golden Path" demo script
- Technical architecture breakdown
- Demo script, architecture docs in markdown
