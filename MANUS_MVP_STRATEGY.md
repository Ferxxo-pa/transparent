# Transparent / TrustClaw — Market Research & Hackathon MVP

**Source:** https://manus.im/share/lMXsXC2X1pn8ZDgeoY9b0K

## Market Opportunity
- AI agents projected to mediate $3-5T in commerce by 2030
- 30% of reviews are fake, costing consumers $787B/year
- **The gap:** Nobody is building verified experience layer for AI agent consumption
- Infrastructure ready: MCP, Google UCP, Stripe Agentic Commerce, receipt OCR APIs

## Key Competitors Researched
- **VeritaTrust** — blockchain verified reviews, not positioned for AI agents
- **Provenance** — verifies product claims, not customer experiences
- **Stripe** — agentic commerce suite (payments, not trust)
- **Google UCP** — Universal Commerce Protocol (transactions, not reviews)
- **Circle.so, Guild.xyz** — community tools, not purchase verification

## The MVP: "TrustClaw" (ETHDenver Hackathon)
**Track:** Hedera — Killer App for Agentic Society ($10,000)

### Components (4-day build)
1. **On-chain verification** — connect wallet, verify NFT/token ownership
2. **Structured feedback** — 5-question form (not free text, machine-readable)
3. **Hedera integration** — HTS reward tokens + HCS immutable attestation
4. **Trust API** — REST endpoints for AI agents to query trust scores
5. **Observer dashboard** — humans watch agents work in real-time

### Tech Stack
- Frontend: Next.js + Tailwind + Hedera SDK
- Backend: Node.js + Express + Supabase
- Hedera: HTS (tokens), HCS (attestations), Mirror Node
- Deploy: Vercel + Railway

### Demo Flow (3 min)
1. Problem: 30% fake reviews, $787B cost
2. Consumer verifies NFT ownership → structured feedback → TRUST tokens
3. AI agent queries API → ranked recommendations with trust scores

### Killer Feature: Agent Reputation Market
- Agents earn reputation for good recommendations
- Stored on-chain, high-rep agents get priority data access
- Creates reputation economy using HTS

### Go-to-Market (Post-Hackathon)
- Phase 1: Partner with 2-3 Hedera NFT projects, 500 verified experiences
- Phase 2: Integrate with OpenClaw + demo agents
- Phase 3: Expand to DeFi, real-world assets, more AI platforms

### Why It Wins
- Agent-first (not human-operated)
- On-chain verification (can't fake)
- Structured data (machine-readable)
- Deep Hedera usage (HTS + HCS + Mirror Node)
- Network effects (more data = better recommendations)
